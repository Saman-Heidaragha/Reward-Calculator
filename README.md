# Reward Calculator â€“ A Haskell-Based Solution
I developed the Reward Calculator to provide an easy way to calculate rewards based on various input factors. Built with Haskell, the tool is designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to understand.

## Purpose:

The main goal of this project is to calculate rewards by processing user inputs such as performance metrics or other relevant factors. The logic behind the calculation is simple, yet adaptable to different scenarios, making it useful for a variety of reward-based systems.

## How It Works:

Input: Users provide values related to performance, time, or other criteria.
Calculation: The tool processes these inputs using predefined rules and calculates the corresponding rewards.
Output: The result is a clear reward value based on the inputs provided.

## Key Features:

Flexible Inputs: Users can adjust the input values to suit different reward systems.
Simple Logic: The reward calculation is easy to follow and modify, making it accessible for various use cases.
Built with Haskell: The project is implemented using Haskell, ensuring reliable, predictable results thanks to its functional programming principles.
